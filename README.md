# 🧠 Brain Tumor Classifier

A deep learning project for classifying brain tumor images using TensorFlow and OpenCV. This project includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.

---

## 📌 Description

This project aims to classify brain tumors from medical images using a convolutional neural network (CNN). It includes a full pipeline from data loading and preprocessing to training and evaluation.

---

## 💻 System Compatibility

This project is compatible with:
* **Linux** (Ubuntu 20.04+)

---

## ⚙️ Requirements

Before proceeding, ensure you have **Conda** installed on your system. You can install it via:

- [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)
- [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/)

> ⚠️ **Note:** This project uses a Conda environment for dependency management.

## 🚀 Installation Guide: Brain Tumor Classifier

Let's get your Brain Tumor Classifier up and running! Follow these simple steps:

### 1. 🌐 Create a New Environment (Recommended)

It's always a good idea to work in a clean environment to avoid conflicts.

```bash
conda create -n brain-tumor-classifier python=3.10 -y
conda activate brain-tumor-classifier
```

### 2. 🔬 Install Core Scientific Packages

We'll install essential libraries with compatible versions for smooth operation.

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge numpy=1.26 matplotlib=3.8.4 pillow=9.5.0 scikit-learn=1.3.0 scikit-image -y
```

### 3. 📊 Set up Jupyter & ipykernel

Get ready for interactive coding and analysis!

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge jupyterlab notebook ipykernel -y
```

 ### 4. 🧠 Install TensorFlow (CPU Version)

Bring on the machine learning power! This version is compatible with numpy 1.26.

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge tensorflow=2.12 -y
```

### 5. 📸 Install OpenCV

For all your computer vision needs!

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge opencv=4.6.0 -y
```

### 6. 🧑‍💻 Install KaggleHub

```bash
pip install kagglehub
```

### 7. 🚀 Opening Your Project in Jupyter Notebook

Once you've followed the installation steps and activated your environment, opening your project is simple!

To open your project and start working with your notebooks, make sure your Conda environment (e.g., brain-tumor-classifier) is activated. Then, simply type the following command in your terminal:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

This command will:

-Start the Jupyter Notebook server.

-Open a new tab in your default web browser, displaying the Jupyter Notebook interface.
